> enforce the versions of the engines of the dependencies to be valid.

- :exclamation: <badge text="This rule has not been released yet." vertical="middle" type="error"> ***This rule has not been released yet.*** </badge>
- :gear: This rule is included in `"plugin:node-dependencies/recommended"`.

## :book: Rule Details

This rule checks the `engines` of the dependencies and reports if they are compatible with the `engines` defined in package.json.

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=8"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "semver": "^7.3.5" /* âœ— BAD: node>=10 is required. */
  }
}
```

## :wrench: Options

```json
{
  "node-dependencies/valid-engines": ["error", {
    "deep": true
  }]
}
```

- `deep` ... If `true`, if the dependency does not have `engines`, it will be checked further dependencies.
